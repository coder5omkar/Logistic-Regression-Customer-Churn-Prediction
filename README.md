# 📊 Logistic Regression - Customer Churn Prediction 😊 


## 📋 General Information
``` 
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The dataset includes churn data, customer data,
internet data. We preprocess the data, perform exploratory analysis, and build a Logistic Regression 
model using Scikit-learn. The model predicts whether a customer will churn or stay. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and 
recall are used to assess performance. Visualizations and insights help interpret model results. The project is implemented in Python with 
libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. To run, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the Jupyter notebook for full 
analysis and predictions.
